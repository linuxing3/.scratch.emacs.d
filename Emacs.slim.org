* 欢迎!

本文件是我的Emacs配置文件的精简版，将被自动编译成 [[file:init.el][init.el]] 文件。


#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  ;; NOTE: init.el is now generated from Emacs.org.  Please edit that file
  ;;       in Emacs and init.el will be generated automatically!

* 安装包管理

Emacs has a built in package manager but it doesn't make it easy to automatically install packages on a new system the first time you pull down your configuration.  [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]] is a really helpful package used in this configuration to make it a lot easier to automate the installation and configuration of everything else we use.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  ;; Initialize package sources
  (require 'package)

  ;; (setq package-archives '(("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/")
  ;;                          ("org" . "https://orgmode.org/elpa/")
  ;;                          ("elpa" . "https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/")))
  ;; ------ 腾讯源 ------
  (setq package-archives '(("gnu"   . "http://mirrors.cloud.tencent.com/elpa/gnu/")
  			 ("melpa" . "http://mirrors.cloud.tencent.com/elpa/melpa/")
  			 ("melpa-stable" . "http://mirrors.cloud.tencent.com/elpa/melpa-stable/")

** Automatic Package Updates

The auto-package-update package helps us keep our Emacs packages up to date!  It will prompt you after a certain number of days either at startup or at a specific time of day to remind you to update your packages.

You can also use =M-x auto-package-update-now= to update right now!

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (use-package auto-package-update
    :custom
    (auto-package-update-interval 7)
    (auto-package-update-prompt-before-update t)
    (auto-package-update-hide-results t)
    :config
    (auto-package-update-maybe)
    (auto-package-update-at-time "09:00"))

* 加载个人配置
** Load my private modules helpers.

Here we just add some helper functions like =dropbox-path= and =workspace-path= 

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.evil.emacs.d/core")
  (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.evil.emacs.d/modules")
  (require 'core-lib)
  (require 'core-helper)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: core-helper

* 目录整洁

We use the [[https://github.com/emacscollective/no-littering/blob/master/no-littering.el][no-littering]] package to keep folders where we edit files and the Emacs configuration folder clean!  It knows about a wide variety of variables for built in Emacs features as well as those from community packages so it can be much easier than finding and setting these variables yourself.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  ;; NOTE: If you want to move everything out of the ~/.emacs.d folder
  ;; reliably, set `user-emacs-directory` before loading no-littering!
  ;(setq user-emacs-directory "~/.cache/emacs")

  (use-package no-littering)

  ;; no-littering doesn't set this by default so we must place
  ;; auto save files in the same path as it uses for sessions
  (setq auto-save-file-name-transforms
        `((".*" ,(no-littering-expand-var-file-name "auto-save/") t)))

#+end_src

* 用户界面配置

This section configures basic UI settings that remove unneeded elements to make Emacs look a lot more minimal and modern.  If you're just getting started in Emacs, the menu bar might be helpful so you can remove the =(menu-bar-mode -1)= line if you'd like to still see that.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

    (add-hook mode (lambda () (display-line-numbers-mode 0))))

#+end_src

** Font Configuration

I am using the [[https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode][Fira Code]] and [[https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Cantarell][Cantarell]] fonts for this configuration which will more than likely need to be installed on your machine.  Both can usually be found in the various Linux distro package managers or downloaded from the links above.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

(set-face-attribute 'default nil :font "Fira Code" :height efs/default-font-size)

;; Set the fixed pitch face
(set-face-attribute 'fixed-pitch nil :font "Fira Code" :height efs/default-font-size)

;; Set the variable pitch face
(set-face-attribute 'variable-pitch nil :font "Cantarell" :height efs/default-variable-font-size :weight 'regular)

* 键盘配置

This configuration uses [[https://evil.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html][evil-mode]] for a Vi-like modal editing experience.  [[https://github.com/noctuid/general.el][general.el]] is used for easy keybinding configuration that integrates well with which-key.  [[https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil-collection][evil-collection]] is used to automatically configure various Emacs modes with Vi-like keybindings for evil-mode.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  ;; Make ESC quit prompts

* 界面高级配置
** Command Log Mode

[[https://github.com/lewang/command-log-mode][command-log-mode]] is useful for displaying a panel showing each key binding you use in a panel on the right side of the frame.  Great for live streams and screencasts!

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (use-package command-log-mode
    :commands command-log-mode)

#+end_src

** Color Theme

[[https://github.com/hlissner/emacs-doom-themes][doom-themes]] is a great set of themes with a lot of variety and support for many different Emacs modes.  Taking a look at the [[https://github.com/hlissner/emacs-doom-themes/tree/screenshots][screenshots]] might help you decide which one you like best.  You can also run =M-x counsel-load-theme= to choose between them easily.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

(use-package doom-themes
  :init (load-theme 'doom-palenight t))

#+end_src

** Better Modeline

[[https://github.com/seagle0128/doom-modeline][doom-modeline]] is a very attractive and rich (yet still minimal) mode line configuration for Emacs.  The default configuration is quite good but you can check out the [[https://github.com/seagle0128/doom-modeline#customize][configuration options]] for more things you can enable or disable.

*NOTE:* The first time you load your configuration on a new machine, you'll need to run `M-x all-the-icons-install-fonts` so that mode line icons display correctly.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp 

(use-package all-the-icons)

(use-package doom-modeline
  :init (doom-modeline-mode 1)
  :custom ((doom-modeline-height 15)))

#+end_src

** Which Key

[[https://github.com/justbur/emacs-which-key][which-key]] is a useful UI panel that appears when you start pressing any key binding in Emacs to offer you all possible completions for the prefix.  For example, if you press =C-c= (hold control and press the letter =c=), a panel will appear at the bottom of the frame displaying all of the bindings under that prefix and which command they run.  This is very useful for learning the possible key bindings in the mode of your current buffer.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (use-package which-key
    :defer 0
    :diminish which-key-mode
    :config
    (which-key-mode)
    (setq which-key-idle-delay 1))

#+end_src

** Ivy and Counsel

[[https://oremacs.com/swiper/][Ivy]] is an excellent completion framework for Emacs.  It provides a minimal yet powerful selection menu that appears when you open files, switch buffers, and for many other tasks in Emacs.  Counsel is a customized set of commands to replace `find-file` with `counsel-find-file`, etc which provide useful commands for each of the default completion commands.

[[https://github.com/Yevgnen/ivy-rich][ivy-rich]] adds extra columns to a few of the Counsel commands to provide more information about each item.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (use-package ivy
    :diminish
    :bind (("C-s" . swiper)
           :map ivy-minibuffer-map
           ("TAB" . ivy-alt-done)
           ("C-l" . ivy-alt-done)
           ("C-j" . ivy-next-line)
           ("C-k" . ivy-previous-line)
           :map ivy-switch-buffer-map
           ("C-k" . ivy-previous-line)
           ("C-l" . ivy-done)
           ("C-d" . ivy-switch-buffer-kill)
           :map ivy-reverse-i-search-map
           ("C-k" . ivy-previous-line)
           ("C-d" . ivy-reverse-i-search-kill))
    :config
    (ivy-mode 1))

  (use-package ivy-rich
    :after ivy
    :init
    (ivy-rich-mode 1))

  (use-package counsel
    :bind (("C-M-j" . 'counsel-switch-buffer)
           :map minibuffer-local-map
           ("C-r" . 'counsel-minibuffer-history))
    :custom
    (counsel-linux-app-format-function #'counsel-linux-app-format-function-name-only)
    :config
    (counsel-mode 1))

*** Improved Candidate Sorting with prescient.el

prescient.el provides some helpful behavior for sorting Ivy completion candidates based on how recently or frequently you select them.  This can be especially helpful when using =M-x= to run commands that you don't have bound to a key but still need to access occasionally.

This Prescient configuration is optimized for use in System Crafters videos and streams, check out the [[https://youtu.be/T9kygXveEz0][video on prescient.el]] for more details on how to configure it!

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (use-package ivy-prescient
    :after counsel
    :custom
    (ivy-prescient-enable-filtering nil)
    :config
    ;; Uncomment the following line to have sorting remembered across sessions!
    ;(prescient-persist-mode 1)
    (ivy-prescient-mode 1))

#+end_src

** Helpful Help Commands

[[https://github.com/Wilfred/helpful][Helpful]] adds a lot of very helpful (get it?) information to Emacs' =describe-= command buffers.  For example, if you use =describe-function=, you will not only get the documentation about the function, you will also see the source code of the function and where it gets used in other places in the Emacs configuration.  It is very useful for figuring out how things work in Emacs.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (use-package helpful
    :commands (helpful-callable helpful-variable helpful-command helpful-key)
    :custom
    (counsel-describe-function-function #'helpful-callable)
    (counsel-describe-variable-function #'helpful-variable)
    :bind
    ([remap describe-function] . counsel-describe-function)
    ([remap describe-command] . helpful-command)
    ([remap describe-variable] . counsel-describe-variable)
    ([remap describe-key] . helpful-key))

#+end_src

** Text Scaling

This is an example of using [[https://github.com/abo-abo/hydra][Hydra]] to design a transient key binding for quickly adjusting the scale of the text on screen.  We define a hydra that is bound to =C-s c s= and, once activated, =j= and =k= increase and decrease the text scale.  You can press any other key (or =f= specifically) to exit the transient key map.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (use-package hydra
    :defer t)

  (defhydra hydra-text-scale (:timeout 4)
    "scale text"
    ("j" text-scale-increase "in")
    ("k" text-scale-decrease "out")
    ("f" nil "finished" :exit t))

  (efs/leader-keys
    "cs" '(hydra-text-scale/body :which-key "scale text"))

#+end_src

* 终端设置
** term-mode

=term-mode= is a built-in terminal emulator in Emacs.  Because it is written in Emacs Lisp, you can start using it immediately with very little configuration.  If you are on Linux or macOS, =term-mode= is a great choice to get started because it supports fairly complex terminal applications (=htop=, =vim=, etc) and works pretty reliably.  However, because it is written in Emacs Lisp, it can be slower than other options like =vterm=.  The speed will only be an issue if you regularly run console apps with a lot of output.

One important thing to understand is =line-mode= versus =char-mode=.  =line-mode= enables you to use normal Emacs keybindings while moving around in the terminal buffer while =char-mode= sends most of your keypresses to the underlying terminal.  While using =term-mode=, you will want to be in =char-mode= for any terminal applications that have their own keybindings.  If you're just in your usual shell, =line-mode= is sufficient and feels more integrated with Emacs.

With =evil-collection= installed, you will automatically switch to =char-mode= when you enter Evil's insert mode (press =i=).  You will automatically be switched back to =line-mode= when you enter Evil's normal mode (press =ESC=).

Run a terminal with =M-x term!=

*Useful key bindings:*

- =C-c C-p= / =C-c C-n= - go back and forward in the buffer's prompts (also =[[= and =]]= with evil-mode)
- =C-c C-k= - Enter char-mode
- =C-c C-j= - Return to line-mode
- If you have =evil-collection= installed, =term-mode= will enter char mode when you use Evil's Insert mode

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (use-package term
    :commands term
    :config
    (setq explicit-shell-file-name "bash") ;; Change this to zsh, etc
    ;;(setq explicit-zsh-args '())         ;; Use 'explicit-<shell>-args for shell-specific args

    ;; Match the default Bash shell prompt.  Update this if you have a custom prompt
    (setq term-prompt-regexp "^[^#$%>\n]*[#$%>] *"))

#+end_src

*** Better term-mode colors

The =eterm-256color= package enhances the output of =term-mode= to enable handling of a wider range of color codes so that many popular terminal applications look as you would expect them to.  Keep in mind that this package requires =ncurses= to be installed on your machine so that it has access to the =tic= program.  Most Linux distributions come with this program installed already so you may not have to do anything extra to use it.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (use-package eterm-256color
    :hook (term-mode . eterm-256color-mode))

#+end_src

** vterm

[[https://github.com/akermu/emacs-libvterm/][vterm]] is an improved terminal emulator package which uses a compiled native module to interact with the underlying terminal applications.  This enables it to be much faster than =term-mode= and to also provide a more complete terminal emulation experience.

Make sure that you have the [[https://github.com/akermu/emacs-libvterm/#requirements][necessary dependencies]] installed before trying to use =vterm= because there is a module that will need to be compiled before you can use it successfully.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (use-package vterm
    :commands vterm
    :config
    (setq term-prompt-regexp "^[^#$%>\n]*[#$%>] *")  ;; Set this to match your custom shell prompt
    ;;(setq vterm-shell "zsh")                       ;; Set this to customize the shell to launch
    (setq vterm-max-scrollback 10000))

#+end_src

** shell-mode

[[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Interactive-Shell.html#Interactive-Shell][shell-mode]] is a middle ground between =term-mode= and Eshell.  It is *not* a terminal emulator so more complex terminal programs will not run inside of it.  It does have much better integration with Emacs because all command input in this mode is handled by Emacs and then sent to the underlying shell once you press Enter.  This means that you can use =evil-mode='s editing motions on the command line, unlike in the terminal emulator modes above.

*Useful key bindings:*

- =C-c C-p= / =C-c C-n= - go back and forward in the buffer's prompts (also =[[= and =]]= with evil-mode)
- =M-p= / =M-n= - go back and forward in the input history
- =C-c C-u= - delete the current input string backwards up to the cursor
- =counsel-shell-history= - A searchable history of commands typed into the shell

One advantage of =shell-mode= on Windows is that it's the only way to run =cmd.exe=, PowerShell, Git Bash, etc from within Emacs.  Here's an example of how you would set up =shell-mode= to run PowerShell on Windows:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (when (eq system-type 'windows-nt)
    (setq explicit-shell-file-name "powershell.exe")
    (setq explicit-powershell.exe-args '()))

#+end_src

** Eshell

[[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/eshell.html#Contributors-to-Eshell][Eshell]] is Emacs' own shell implementation written in Emacs Lisp.  It provides you with a cross-platform implementation (even on Windows!) of the common GNU utilities you would find on Linux and macOS (=ls=, =rm=, =mv=, =grep=, etc).  It also allows you to call Emacs Lisp functions directly from the shell and you can even set up aliases (like aliasing =vim= to =find-file=).  Eshell is also an Emacs Lisp REPL which allows you to evaluate full expressions at the shell.

The downsides to Eshell are that it can be harder to configure than other packages due to the particularity of where you need to set some options for them to go into effect, the lack of shell completions (by default) for some useful things like Git commands, and that REPL programs sometimes don't work as well.  However, many of these limitations can be dealt with by good configuration and installing external packages, so don't let that discourage you from trying it!

*Useful key bindings:*

- =C-c C-p= / =C-c C-n= - go back and forward in the buffer's prompts (also =[[= and =]]= with evil-mode)
- =M-p= / =M-n= - go back and forward in the input history
- =C-c C-u= - delete the current input string backwards up to the cursor
- =counsel-esh-history= - A searchable history of commands typed into Eshell

We will be covering Eshell more in future videos highlighting other things you can do with it.

** Dired

Dired is a built-in file manager for Emacs that does some pretty amazing things!  Here are some key bindings you should try out:

*** Key Bindings

**** Navigation

*Emacs* / *Evil*
- =n= / =j= - next line
- =p= / =k= - previous line
- =j= / =J= - jump to file in buffer
- =RET= - select file or directory
- =^= - go to parent directory
- =S-RET= / =g O= - Open file in "other" window
- =M-RET= - Show file in other window without focusing (previewing files)
- =g o= (=dired-view-file=) - Open file but in a "preview" mode, close with =q=
- =g= / =g r= Refresh the buffer with =revert-buffer= after changing configuration (and after filesystem changes!)

**** Marking files

- =m= - Marks a file
- =u= - Unmarks a file
- =U= - Unmarks all files in buffer
- =* t= / =t= - Inverts marked files in buffer
- =% m= - Mark files in buffer using regular expression
- =*= - Lots of other auto-marking functions
- =k= / =K= - "Kill" marked items (refresh buffer with =g= / =g r= to get them back)
- Many operations can be done on a single file if there are no active marks!

**** Copying and Renaming files

If non-nil, Dired tries to guess a default target directory. This means: if there is a Dired buffer displayed in some window, use its
current directory, instead of this Dired buffer's current directory.

- =C= - Copy marked files (or if no files are marked, the current file)
- Copying single and multiple files
- =U= - Unmark all files in buffer
- =R= - Rename marked files, renaming multiple is a move!
- =% R= - Rename based on regular expression: =^test= , =old-\&=

*Power command*: =C-x C-q= (=dired-toggle-read-only=) - Makes all file names in the buffer editable directly to rename them!  Press =Z Z= to confirm renaming or =Z Q= to abort.

**** Deleting files

- =D= - Delete marked file
- =d= - Mark file for deletion
- =x= - Execute deletion for marks
- =delete-by-moving-to-trash= - Move to trash instead of deleting permanently

**** Creating and extracting archives

- =Z= - Compress or uncompress a file or folder to (=.tar.gz=)
- =c= - Compress selection to a specific file
- =dired-compress-files-alist= - Bind compression commands to file extension

**** Other common operations

- =T= - Touch (change timestamp)
- =M= - Change file mode
- =O= - Change file owner
- =G= - Change file group
- =S= - Create a symbolic link to this file
- =L= - Load an Emacs Lisp file into Emacs

*** Configuration

* 应用程序

** Some App

This is an example of configuring another non-Emacs application using org-mode.  Not only do we write out the configuration at =.config/some-app/config=, we also compute the value that gets stored in this configuration from the Emacs Lisp block above it.

#+NAME: the-value
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no

  (+ 55 100)

#+end_src

*NOTE*: Set the =:tangle= parameter below to =.config/some-app/config= for this to work!

#+begin_src conf :tangle no :noweb yes

  value=<<the-value()>>

* Org Mode

[[https://orgmode.org/][Org Mode]] is one of the hallmark features of Emacs.  It is a rich document editor, project planner, task and time tracker, blogging engine, and literate coding utility all wrapped up in one package.

*** Center Org Buffers

We use [[https://github.com/joostkremers/visual-fill-column][visual-fill-column]] to center =org-mode= buffers for a more pleasing writing experience as it centers the contents of the buffer horizontally to seem more like you are editing a document.  This is really a matter of personal preference so you can remove the block below if you don't like the behavior.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (defun efs/org-mode-visual-fill ()
    (setq visual-fill-column-width 100
          visual-fill-column-center-text t)
    (visual-fill-column-mode 1))

  (use-package visual-fill-column
    :hook (org-mode . efs/org-mode-visual-fill))

#+end_src

** 结构模板 Structure Templates

Org Mode's [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Structure-Templates.html][structure templates]] feature enables you to quickly insert code blocks into your Org files in combination with =org-tempo= by typing =<= followed by the template name like =el= or =py= and then press =TAB=.  For example, to insert an empty =emacs-lisp= block below, you can type =<el= and press =TAB= to expand into such a block.

You can add more =src= block templates below by copying one of the lines and changing the two strings at the end, the first to be the template name and the second to contain the name of the language [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/languages.html][as it is known by Org Babel]].

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (with-eval-after-load 'org
    ;; This is needed as of Org 9.2
    (require 'org-tempo)

    (add-to-list 'org-structure-template-alist '("sh" . "src shell"))
    (add-to-list 'org-structure-template-alist '("el" . "src emacs-lisp"))
    (add-to-list 'org-structure-template-alist '("py" . "src python")))

** 自动生成 Auto-tangle Configuration Files

This snippet adds a hook to =org-mode= buffers so that =efs/org-babel-tangle-config= gets executed each time such a buffer gets saved.  This function checks to see if the file being saved is the Emacs.org file you're looking at right now, and if so, automatically exports the configuration here to the associated output files.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  ;; Automatically tangle our Emacs.org config file when we save it
  (defun efs/org-babel-tangle-config ()
    (when (string-equal (file-name-directory (buffer-file-name))
                        (expand-file-name user-emacs-directory))
      ;; Dynamic scoping to the rescue
      (let ((org-confirm-babel-evaluate nil))
        (org-babel-tangle))))

  (add-hook 'org-mode-hook (lambda () (add-hook 'after-save-hook #'efs/org-babel-tangle-config)))
